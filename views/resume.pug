    p Currently working in a lab that produces custom DNA oligonucleotides. I have developed various tools to streamline the production process including:
    ul 
      li #[a(href="") vCheck]: A GUI JavaFX application to streamline a quality control process that gives employees a visual way of passing/failing final product and decreases the overall process time of final product by 50%.
      li #[a(href="") Patches]: A command line tool for merging multiple text data files into a single, aggregate file. 
    p My primary duties include synthesizing, purifying and performing quality control sampling and anlysis on oligonucleotides for academic and industrial use.
