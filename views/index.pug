    h1 Hey, I'm Daniel.
    p I am a scientist and hobbyist programmer who has a passion for clean, readable code.
    p Here I keep a collection of projects and oddities that I have worked on over the years, from my days as a student all the way up to today.
    p I live in San Diego, where I currently work at a biotech company that manufacutures DNA oligonucleotides (that's a cool way of saying short DNA molecules). Although lately I have been veering into the more coding side of things. Contact me to learn more. (My contact info is at the top left of the page, just below my name).
